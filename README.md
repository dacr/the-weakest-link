# OESW - The Weakest Link challenge - app source code
The sound track : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJnm43i6Rr4 

Let’s discover the distributed tracing system named Jaeger (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger)
through a game inspired from the “Weakest Link” (TV game show).
The idea is during the OESW days ask anyone with a laptop, to come and join us for this game,
and we will try to interconnect our computers to build the longest chain, each of us adding
a new message.
Once the chain is up, we’ll send the initial HTTP request (JSON POST), and thanks to the Jaeger
User interface every-body will be able to take a look to the global trace and find who was the
current weakest link ! (We’ll have to tell someone to change his code…)
